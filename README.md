## Simon Game (Kotlin)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Simon memory game, built using Kotlin for Android.

**Overview:**

This project aims to provide a basic, functional Simon game experience. The app generates a sequence of colored lights, and the player must repeat the sequence correctly. Each successful round increases the sequence length, testing the player's memory.

**Key Features:**

* **Random Sequence Generation:** The app generates a random sequence of colors.
* **Visual Feedback:** The app highlights the colors in the sequence.
* **User Input:** The player interacts with the app by tapping the colored buttons.
* **Score Tracking:** The app keeps track of the player's highest successful sequence.
* **Game Over Logic:** The app detects incorrect sequences and ends the game.
